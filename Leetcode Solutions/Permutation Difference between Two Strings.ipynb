    "# 3146. Permutation Difference between Two Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two strings `s` and `t` such that every character occurs at most once in `s` and `t` is a permutation of `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The permutation difference between `s` and `t` is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in `s` and the index of the occurrence of the same character in `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the permutation difference between `s` and `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `s = \"abc\"`, `t = \"bac\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For `s = \"abc\"` and `t = \"bac\"`, the permutation difference of `s` and `t` is equal to the sum of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of \"a\" in `s` and the index of the occurrence of \"a\" in `t`.\n",
    "- The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of \"b\" in `s` and the index of the occurrence of \"b\" in `t`.\n",
    "- The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of \"c\" in `s` and the index of the occurrence of \"c\" in `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the permutation difference between `s` and `t` is equal to `|0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `s = \"abcde\"`, `t = \"edbac\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `12`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The permutation difference between `s` and `t` is equal to `|0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4 - 0| = 12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length <= 26`\n",
    "- Each character occurs at most once in `s`.\n",
    "- `t` is a permutation of `s`.\n",
    "- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n"
